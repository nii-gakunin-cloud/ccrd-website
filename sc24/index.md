# Academic Information Infrastructure for Data-Driven Science

The National Institute of Informatics (NII) seeks to advance integrated research and development activities in informationrelated fields, including networking, software, and content. NII also promotes the creation of state-of-the-art academic information infrastructure, designed by fusing the ultra high-speed network, SINET6, and the research data platform, NII Research Data Cloud, to promote data-driven science.

# Development of a Hybrid Job Deployment Platform Using Open OnDemand

With the widespread adoption of Open OnDemand, users without sufficient knowledge of Linux systems can now submit jobs to HPC clusters. However, constructing HPC clusters remains difficult. We are developing Virtual Cloud Provider (VCP) middleware to support the construction of data analysis platforms, e.g., HPC clusters. VCP enables users to easily configure an HPC cluster and deploy software libraries required by applications, including GPU libraries, OpenHPC, and Open OnDemand, instead of HPC system administrators.

# Zero Trust based IoT Security

This project aims to realize secure Internet of Things (IoT) systems by the concept of zero trust by the fusion of formal verification and system software technologies. In formal verification research, we provide mathematical proofs for the legitimacy of IoT trust chains and address undiscovered threats by combining static and dynamic verification. In system software research, we develop mechanisms for isolated execution, automatic detection and automatic countermeasures in conjunction with the theoretical results to demonstrate zero trust IoT (ZT-IoT).

# Operation Technologies for Next-Generation HPC Infrastructure

Japan is planning to develop a successor to the supercomputer “Fugaku,” Fugaku- NEXT, and is considering a next-generation computing infrastructure that would federate Fugaku-NEXT, major supercomputers in Japan, clouds, etc. In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, RIKEN R-CCS, and Institute of Science Tokyo, we investigate the operation technologies required by the computing infrastructure and introduce the topics of resource management and security.
